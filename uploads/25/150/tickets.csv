1869,"Announcing AWS Import/Export for Amazon EBS","Dear Amazon Web Services Customer, Today we?re excited to announce support for importing data into Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) using AWS Import/Export. AWS Import/Export accelerates moving large amounts of data into and out of AWS using portable storage devices for transport. Amazon EBS provides storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances. With Import to Amazon EBS in the US East (Virginia) and US West (Northern California) regions, you can now quickly transfer data into Amazon EBS by shipping storage devices to AWS. AWS Import/Export transfers your data off of storage devices into AWS by using Amazon?s high-speed internal network and bypassing the Internet. If you have large amounts of data to load and an Internet connection with limited bandwidth, the time required to prepare and ship a portable storage device to AWS can be a small percentage of the time it would take to transfer your data over the internet. If loading your data over the Internet would take more than a few days, you should consider using AWS Import/Export. AWS Import/Export now supports importing data directly into Amazon EBS snapshots off of eSATA and USB storage devices, as well as internal SATA hard drives. Once loaded into an Amazon EBS snapshot, you can create a volume based on that snapshot and attach it to an Amazon EC2 instance, or you can share that snapshot with others. To import into an Amazon EBS snapshot, simply: - Prepare a portable storage device with your data onit. - Submit a Create Job request to AWS that includes your return shipping address. You?ll receive back a unique identifier for the job, a barcode to identify your device, and an AWS address to ship your storage device to. - Securely identify your device by attaching the bar code to it. - Ship your device to AWS. When your package arrives, it will be processed and transferred to an AWS data center for data loading. After the data load completes, the device will be returned to you. Get started using AWS Import/Export today at http://aws.amazon.com/importexport. Sincerely, The AWS Import/Export Team We hope you enjoyed receiving this message.

1924,"Assist with Trust Connecting Applications for Leads","Hi Avery, We are working with John Emerson on a Dutch lead. They provided the URL's below, and I have tried to configure this on our sandbox, see: URL: https://portal.singlepoint29.com User: user29 Password: passworduser However from the 4 provided applications I only get the Sharepoint working. The others: SiS system is using a port in the URL. How do I need to proceed with this because it is not accepted in the configuration? Sun Identity Management throws me an error ' Unexpected error (E4375665)' during the Discover HTTP Fed setup of the login form URL . Next I tried to configure the application manually but did not succeed. HvA Webcolleges is using an adfs (Surfnet) so I assume we need to go for SAML rather than HTTP Fed? Can you help me out?

2042,"Issues with IE","This started recently (not exactly sure when, but it cannot have been more than a week). Certain images are not being loaded for users using our provider portal with IE (both 8 and 9 are affected - don't know about earlier versions). The images all load fine on Chrome, FF, Opera, and Safari - only IE is affected. It happens on both sides of our firewall, so I don't think it is related to any changes in our network setup. In a nutshell, when certain images are requested IE fails to load them. It is not our server returning a not found error - in fact our server is returning a 200/OK and the fiddler logs show that the IDR is also returning a 200/OK. However, the response headers are loaded with this set-cookie statement: Set-Cookie: SPBALANCEID=balancer.172.16.1.86; path=/; domain=.tsghealthcare.com It repeats at least 200 or more times in the header. That is the only thing I can see different about them. I think IE is choking because the header is too big, but that is just a guess. No matter how many times I retry the request, I get back the same header with tons of set-cookie statements. If I alter the case of the path (i.e. ""LOGO.gif"" instead of ""logo.gif"") the request completes normally and the header only contains 1 set-cookie statment. I have fiddler logs if needed. This is a very serious concern for us at is is dramatically affecting certain functionality on our portal for everyone using IE (which is probably the majority of our users). And help you could provide to expedite the handling of this would be appreciated.",2011-04-09 08:51:00,2011-04-09 09:46:00,"heath_provost@schumachergroup.com","Schumacher Group","josh@symplified.com","problem","closed","normal","Web,Problem Report,Troubleshooting Provided"

I provided him with concur login info and he's still not able to connect to concur via moodys net.

2199,"Certificate update @ Salesforce","We received an e-mail from Salesforce about an update to a certificate and wanted to ensure that our connectivity will be uninterrupted. Is there anything we need to do in order to avoid any issues using the Salesforce service through Symplified's SSO product? Thanks! Scott At salesforce.com, customer success is our top priority, and it is our goal to make you aware of any changes that could affect your use of Salesforce. You are receiving this email because we have identified you as a system administrator of a salesforce.com organization that may be impacted by the upcoming expiration of a client certificate. What is the change? The salesforce.com client certificate named proxy.salesforce.com is expiring on January 7, 2011. Customers who authenticate this certificate via any of the following methods may need to download the latest certificate: * Delegated authentication with a HTTPS URL * Workflow outbound messaging with a HTTPS URL * Customers using service provider (SP) initiated SAML for single sign-on When is this change taking effect? The old client is expiring on January 7, 2011. The new client certificate will be updated on January 6, 2011. What action must I take? If your delegated authentication or workflow outbound messaging servers do not require client certificates and if you do not use SAML for authentication, then no further action by you is required. If your servers request a client certificate, or if you use SAML, then you may need to download the newest proxy.salesforce.com client certificate prior to January 6 by visiting http://wiki.developerforce.com/index.php/Client_Certificate, or logging a case with Support. Servers and SAML identity providers that match the complete client certificate from an incoming connection with the old certificate will need to be updated to also accept the new version of the proxy.salesforce.com certificate. After the old certificate expires on January 7, 2011, the expired certificate can be removed from the servers and SAML identity providers. Servers and SAML identity providers that do not match the complete client certificate with a stored value, but check the client certificate's distinguished name (DN) and verify its trust chain will not be affected by this update to the proxy.salesforce.com client certificate. How can I get more information? For more information on client certificates and best practices recommended by salesforce.com, please visit http://wiki.developerforce.com/index.php/Client_Certificate.

2285,"DOCS - Web Service User Store","The Web Service User Store API document needs to be updated to reflect to the reader that ""If you do not implement like this, things will not work"" This is especially important with the error messages section. We need a note in that section to tell the user that you MUST implement to these specifications, otherwise your web service user store will not work. There are some other minor modifications I would like to be made. In general, each section needs to tell the user along with API specs when these calls are made by the IDR and what they are used for. Appliance Login URL: need to say that this must allow for multiple concurrent logins by and IDR and a login without a graceful logout. We should also specify when this would be called: on an IDR startup, if ""test"" is pressed in the user store screen, if ""refresh attributes"" is pressed, or on publish. ID Router Logout URL: need to say when this is actually done...not actually sure when this is and might be a product bug, but should be done on IDR shutdown and publish. User Store Properties URL: Might want to put a screenshot of the attributes screen of a web service user store so that a developer knows how this is used. Otherwise, they don't see how it plays into the IDR. User Detauls URL - I would put this after the User authentication URL section. Say that this happens after a user authenticates and these values are used to either pass to applications in the header or for access controls that have been put on application. User Authentication URL - Say that this happens each time a user authenticates to the IDR. This gives the developer a better picture of how often this page is called. Error Handling: The Web service MUST respond with a message.... instead of should respond. I would also do. I would also reformat the way that this section is to better match the other sections. I would have each error type have its own heading like is done for User Authentication, User Details, User Store Properties URL, etc.... This will drive home the importance of a properly formatted Error Type. In addition to changing the actual document, we need to provide sample code for a web service user store and Web Service Description Language (WSDL) that a developer could point to and implement all of these methods. This would make things much easier and ensure that it is implemented to our specifications. Last, it would be great to have a test script to where a URL can be plugged in and it tells them if they have implemented each page correctly. This could be part of the sample code.",2010-09-29 05:54:00,2011-07-15 12:53:00,"mparris@symplified.com","Symplified, Inc.","amcgill@symplified.com","problem","closed","normal","Internal,Problem Report,Bug - Scheduled for Prod"

If you login, you will get to the SSO portal and not to the concur landing page. With IWA, this should not do a redirect to login.jsf and instead do a redirect to the login Servlet to leverage IWA as IWA is ignored when the login.jsf page is accessed. The redirect should also be embedded within the login process so that the proper concur page can be ""deep linked"" when this condition occurs. This has been validated locally in an IWA environment using Moodys Concur configuration and account and is also occurring at Moodys. Confirmed that this is related to the inactivity timeout. If this timeout is increased to a value larger than the Concur timeout and a Concur timeout happens, you can deep link back into Concur.

2296,"Continue Authentication of end users even if user store is unavailable.","The way user store hunting works (when you configure more than one user store), is not programmed to provide setting up a ""back-up"" user store. Specifically, if you have more thane one user stores configured, and one of them becomes unavailable, then when a user goes to authenticate, the downed user store times-out and the entire authentication process is aborted. So, no user will be able to login. Multiple user stores can be setup as user store objects. But at the application level, of all the user stores listed, if any of them are unavailable, users will not be able to login. This request is to change this functionality so that if multiple user stores are setp and the App and App Folder level, if one is unavailable, the others are used for Authentication. This will allow us to setup ""back-up"" user stores and our customers will get uninterrupted service if one of their user stores becomes unavailable. Thanks ---------------- Current work around is to leave only one user store setup at the app level. In the event the configured user store fails, you will have to change the configuration in SinglePoint Studio so that an available user store is active, and then publish. This would take a few minutes. All your existing user sessions would not be affected - during these few minutes of downtime, all that is affected is new users logging in.",2010-09-20 04:57:00,2011-08-01 01:16:00,"support@symplified.com","Symplified, Inc.","amcgill@symplified.com","problem","closed","normal","Phone,Problem Report,Bug - Scheduled for Prod"

Having rolled it out to approximately 25 pilot users, we have encountered some problems with part of the population. While several users have been able to get into Discovery Archive without a hitch, several others have encountered freezing-up problems during sign in. Specifically, the symptom revolves around the login apparently succeeding, as the correct mailbox is opened, but the screen freezes during the painting process. The outer portions of the screen paint successfully...showing, for example, Bob Goalwin?s mailbox in the upper left corner of the interface. However, when Discovery Archive attempts to actually load the email records...displaying the circular processing icon...the icon eventually stops spinning...and the app locks up. For those who encounter the problem, the issue shows up when running both Internet Explorer 6 and Firefox 3.5.8. The same issue occurs when opening from a web folder within Outlook. The interesting thing is that for most of those encountering the problem, we can get the system to work every third or fourth attempt. Symplified folks...any idea what could be causing this from within your interface...? LiveOffice folks...have you encountered anything like this with your normal sign on...? Is there something that some of us may be running...or not running...that causes this problem for some and not others?

Going to that URL got me to the IDR with the prompt that my password wasn?t accepted (expected behavior). When I submitted my password I was redirected to the main login screen for the mail archive (unexpected behavior), where I had to put in my password again. At that point I was in the application. Every time I hit the IDR now I get passed to the main logon screen for the mail archive app. It is like the IDR is authenticating me to have the right to visit the logon screen, where I can then enter my mail archive password and use the application. Instead of SSO, it seems like we?ve got one extra authentication step now required by the user. Authenticate to IDR, then authenticate to LOMA. Please advise when you have the chance.

Search on ""managing self-service users"" in Salesforce.com help for more information. If ""Non self-service user"" is selected, then you must know the table name your user information can be found in.

2523,"Mysterious Login Not Working Issue","Topher asked to open a ticket about this. Both he and Colin reviewed it on 5/22/09. The problem is, we don't know how to recreate it. What we know is this: Sometimes you can login and then not explicitly logout. Then when you go back to the portal (portal-12.simplemach.com) you get sent to the login page (as you should). Problem is you enter the correct credentials, but you are redirected back to the login page with the message the creds were invalid. When you look at watchlogs, it says the user is Authenticated. We know these things about this: 1. We see it on the 12DOT user and router that is currently attached to production. This is the trial environment for Serena. 2. It only happens if you don't explicitly logout (as far as we can tell). 3. It does not appear to be related to the 'Inactivity Timeout' setting at the customer level in SPS. I say this because we changed that setting to 5 seconds and let a user get a force logout and the login problem did not happen. 4. It does not appear to be related to the portal-12.simplemach.com ""singlepoint"" cookie. I say this because we deleted that one cookie and the problem still existed. 5.

You have hit the nail on the head with SAN - you need a name for every possible app. Currently, you are running:mailarchivepeoplecapitalworkdaysymssosymsso1symsso2.amylin.comSo, at the least the SAN would have to cover those + ""sfdc-delegated.amylin.com"" or something similar. The obvious limitation/issue here is that you have to update and resign a cert with each new app. Some customers have adopted a generic app naming convention to get around this, and just register app01, app02, app03...app0X.Either approach is valid, but if you are OK with a wildcard it is our suggested approach.-MatthewOn Tue, Jul 26, 2011 at 11:18 AM, McWethy, Cameron <Cameron.McWethy@amylin.com> wrote:Let&#39;s do option one. Your assistance in generating the CSR would only be required if there are special considerations for the certificate (including special SAN considerations). If we direct people to the IDR using FQDNs in the format of appname.amylin.com do we need a SAN for every possible app name to prevent browser warnings?

It's not very clean I admit, and no one is doing it currently, but that approach would, I believe, work. Andrew reply:The referrer approach was what I was initially was going to take, but it doesn't seem to bear itself out in reality.My experience is that I'm not seeing a referrer header populated at the login.jsp when an application is requested. I've placed the headers I'm seeing at the bottom of this note.

The Recycle Bin link in the sidebar will now let you restore recently deleted records for 15 days before they are permanently deleted.Additionally, we are lowering the Recycle Bin record limit from 250 times your storage to 25 times your storage. For example, if your organization has 1 GB of storage then your limit is 25 times 1000 MB or 25,000 records. If your organization reaches its Recycle Bin limit, Salesforce will automatically remove the oldest records if they have been in the Recycle Bin for at least two hours.When is this change taking effect? The lower Recycle Bin retention period will go into effect with the Winter '12 Release.What action must I take? There is no action necessary on your part.How can I get more information?

It was pretty much what I expected but I just wanted to verify. How can we create this custom view to group AD integrated/non-AD integrated solutions and their respective passwords? Also, would it be possible for an admin to set the username and password of a user’s keychain or keychain group? This way, when a user is onboarded and needs access to a completely outside system, the admin would create the user account and an obnoxiously long yet secure password. Can this password be pre-entered into Symplified so the user would never have to change it? Can the entry be automated or batch processed?OWA version: 8.2.234.1Thanks,AndyFrom: Brian Gaffney [mailto:bgaffney@symplified.com] Sent: Tuesday, August 30, 2011 10:01 AMTo: Andy LeeSubject: Re: Symplified POC UpdateGood to hear you are making progress.

I actually got Crowd to partially work. It logs in, but won’t go to the correct landing page. We think it’s more of a Crowd issue than Symplified. I don’t think we need a specialized connector – we just need to figure out where to land.I was actually trying to get our webmail, Exchange Outlook Web Access, to connect with HTTP-Fed but it wasn’t picking up any fields. Any pointers there?>> What version of OWA are you using. Let me check on that one, we might have an application specific adapter for it.We’ll be working on zScaler and Blackline SAML shortly. I’ll let you know when those guys get back to us.Question: 1.)With every HTTP-Fed/SAML application, will the user need to type in an initial password or can we pass through the AD creds?>> Each user has a key chain. Each key in the key chain is an encrypted file that contains their credentials they use to login to a specific application. When an application uses SAML, the IdR does not need a key and therefore no key chain entry is required (no action by an admin or a user required).When the IdR uses HTTP-FED to sign into the application it needs to replay the login ceremony ... imitate the user&#39;s post sequence ... and therefore needs access to the clear text version of the credentials. Since AD stores a hash of the password, the IdR cannot recover the credential and therefore cannot replay the credential. By default, the setting of keys is done on an application by application basis.Setting of the key chains can also be a custom view. This allows the user to do password synchronization for a bunch of applications ... user thinks they are updating one password BUT they are actually setting up key chain entries for many different applications. You might have a form for each ""family"" of applications. Set here for ""AD Applications"", Set here for ""Attlassian Crown"" applications (assuming they are not driven by AD. You might just have a single page to use a universal key in all applications and make it based on AD username or password. Those choices are up to you based on your security policy.So ...either the user needs to update the key chain or the administrator updates the key chain (some companies actually block the setting of these credentials by the user) or use a mix.Does that help? 2.)How do we handle authentication if the web application pops up a Window as in standard basic web authentication. For example, in Firefox: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/wa-pz-security/basic_auth.jpg>> No Problem, just create an Http-Basic Adapter instead of HTTP-FED. Should be on the right hand side of the Trust Connector page. It functions similar to HTTP-FED in that you have a key chain entry, the difference being in the way that information is passed to the application.3.)What can you tell me about SSO to Go. iPads, iPhones, Androids, and Android tablets are huge here.>> SSO to Go is more of a marketing campaign than a technology. The features allow you to mark some application to be accessible to mobile devices (iOS things, Andriod things, etc). The SSO is still web based (as opposed to a native OS specific application) but the form factor for the user experience is more appropriate for the device.

Product & Service Notification RE: Org ID 00D500000007EiFDear Symplified, Salesforce.com is committed to providing a highly available service to our customers. We are committed to continued investments to increase the overall uptime of our service, to deliver optimal value to our customers. With that, we are excited to announce a major advancement in this area for our major releases, effective with our Winter '12 release.What is the change? We are happy to inform you that we are improving our major release upgrade process. This improvement means that your organization will be generally available during our major release upgrade windows.Note: The term ""Generally Available"" means that we are conducting maintenance on the system that should be seamless to the customer. However, there is the remote possibility that there could be a disruption to service during this time.When is the Winter '12 major release? The Winter '12 release for your organization on NA3 is scheduled for: Friday, October 14, 2011 8:00pm PT to Saturday, October 15, 2011 2:00am PT (Saturday, October 15, 2011 03:00 - 09:00 UTC)How will this change affect me? Previously, major release upgrades required up to six (6) hours of maintenance, during which the Salesforce service was unavailable. Effective with Winter '12, your Salesforce service will be generally available during the major release upgrade. Your organization should expect to experience a disruption of up to five (5) minutes during the timeframe listed above. Users will receive an error message informing them that the service is momentarily unavailable while we upgrade it to the latest release, and will be prompted to log back in momentarily. After that time, you will be able to access the Winter '12 release.Please note: This currently only applies to our major release windows, executed three (3) times per year. System maintenance windows are currently not part of the scope of this changeWhere can I go for further information? This information will also be posted at http://trust.salesforce.com/trust/status/#maint.We are thrilled to be able to bring these availability improvements to our customers, and look forward to continuing our investment in high availability with you and your business.Best regards, salesforce.com Customer Support Copyright 2000-2011 salesforce.com - All rights reserved.

Reports are coming in that authentication is now failing for our apps front-ended by the Symplified appliances in San Diego. Users are reporting that they land on the main Symplified portal page, and from there are unable to authenticate.Is there something you can do on your side to confirm we didn't interrupt our production configuration in San Diego by introducing these new appliances?The new ones in PHX have been configured with the same host names as the old ones in SD, but no DNS updates have been done to redirect traffic to PHX yet.Support is CC'ed in the event everyone has gone home for the day.

3063,"Re: Concur Password reset Sev 1 issue","Thanks Avery.I'll double check with Naresh but I don't believe we've ever change this nor do we have the option too. Concur's session timeout should be the same across their clients. Also I guess what I don't understand is why so random why is it not happening to me after I had resetted my password once, why is Michelle the only individual who consistently having her account locked after session time out. I do think others are getting it too but seems at least with other if we do a one time reset everything is okay but with Michelle it's been consistent. Could something have gone wrong on the identity router on storing her credentials. It just seems we somehow always manage to have these random unexplainable issues with the http fed solution.ThanksMarkFrom: Avery McGill <amcgill@symplified.com>To: Lin, MarkCc: Symplified Support <support@symplified.com>; Frey, Patricia; Vic Lanzillotti <vlanzillotti@symplified.com>; Joshua Forman <josh@symplified.com>; Nekkanti, NareshSent: Tue Sep 27 22:39:37 2011Subject: Re: Concur Password reset Sev 1 issueMark,I sent you a previous email letting you know I was available from 1 - 2 PM EDT, I can also be available at 9 AM EDT / 7 AM MDT. Please let me know if you are available and I can call you. In the interim, can you please set your Concur session timeout to match or exceed the SSO timeout (99999 seconds)? The functionality is working as expected, however I believe that because Concur&#39;s session timeout is less than our SSO timeout, this issue is occurring and the link that the user is connecting to does not have the force-sso=true tag because this occurred during a normal session. When you arrive first thing in the morning, can you please check with your team to see if anyone has made a change to Concur recently? There haven&#39;t been any changes made to your SSO portal and thus I believe that the change originated on the Concur side.Also, for future reference, please do not include Max on emails as he is not part of the Service Delivery team any longer and does not respond to support requests.

Such versions are potentially affected by multiple vulnerabilities:§ Apache contains a vulnerability in apr_fnmatch.c used in the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library and the Apache Portable Utility library (aka APR-util) when handling URIs with crafted wildcard patterns. An application that uses APR could be exploited by attackers to cause a denial of service condition.§ A TLS renegotiation prefix injection attack is possible.

3168,"8.11 DNS update bug","Background: Schumacher's internal IdR became unavailable the morning after the 8.11 upgrade (10/5/11). Upon initial inspection, Schumachers IdR's was throwing IWA / Likewise errors caused by the ability to return SRV records from the domain controller which in turn resulted from using Schumacher's external DNS and not the internal DNS as we should have been. The change in DNS servers occurred as a result of the upgrade. According to conversations with Max, this was most likely caused by the lack of DNS entry in the nameserverList tag in the /usr/local/symplified/etc/appliance.property file. Since this entry was missing, the DNS server as configured in the dns.nameservers tag in the same file was used (now deprecated). This tag most likely had the incorrect DNS server because they were originally configured without IWA. Of course, we don't know this for 100%, this is our best guess.Bug: We believe their was a null value in the file listed above causing the system not to have a DNS entry after the upgrade.

3169,"8.11 infinite redirect loop","Background: We encountered an issue where a condition occurred that caused the IdR's login service to experience an infinite redirect loop that consumed all the IdR's memory and resulted in cratering the box in a matter of a few minutes (~600 auth requests per minute). This condition is very similar to a DOS attack and was a result of a user attempting to log in via IWA, the IdR redirecting to the IWA auth module, which observed a bad spnego token, and redirected the user back to the login servlet. At this point, the browser is not supposed to resend the spnego token, but it did, and thus entering the infinite loop. After restarting the IdR, services were restored. Unfortunately, the infinite redirect loop also caused the logs to rotate in a matter of minutes as well, destroying all evidence of the original issue. I had Jamie Domingue ask everyone to log out and log back in, which has apparently fixed the issue as it has not reoccurred. Topher and Max have no idea how or why this could have happened as it appears as though it was caused by a malfunctioning browser and have been unable to reproduce it.

3170,"8.11 SimpleLink Time out. ","Background: SVB experienced an outage that prevented the end user from authenticating into the portal. The end users received a login servlet error when connecting to the portal. Examining the logs showed that the SimpleLink service was starting, thinking it wasn't started, and restarting, causing tun1 (SimpleLink VPN tunnel) to flap (note the PID on the SimpleLink service was constantly changing as the service constantly restarted). The SimpleLink service is a dependency of the login service and as a result, prevented the login service from always being available (intermittently a user was able to authenticate). Initially JVH and Max thought that dual SimpleLink client server processes had been initiated, but after confirming this was not the case via tcupdumps and looking at the output of ps -ef | grep vpn (showing only one SimpleLink service with a single pid), this was ruled out. After further examination with Colin (who worked on the HA SimpleLink functionality), we finally isolated it to a part of the SimpleLink HA code that restarts the SimpleLink service if the connection to the existing SimpleLink service dies (this allows for the second SimpleLink client server to establish a VPN tunnel- thus SimpleLink HA). After re-establishing the SimpleLink VPN tunnel, we looked at the network between the IdR and the SimpleLink client server and noticed that there was upwards of 20% packet loss and a lot of latency (pings in excess of 200+ ms at times). As a result of networking issues, our SimpleLink service was timing out on the first connection and attempting to fail over to the second SimpleLink server (that didn't exist) and thus stomping on the original SimpleLink service once it was able to establish a new connection. We have customized SVB's IdR to revert the SimpleLink code base to the 8.10.1 configuration by manually editing the SimpleLink application code (eek). Bug: Currently SimpleLink HA does not tolerate poor network performance. We want the ability to enable SimpleLink HA that works as currently configured and not enable HA SimpleLink- that works as it did before and thus supports existing customers with poor network performance.

3200,"Additional IP Addresses for Your Salesforce.com Organization","Additional IP Addresses for Your Salesforce.com Organization   You are receiving this email because our records indicate you are an administrator of a Salesforce CRM Org. Product & Service Notification RE: Org ID 00D500000007EiFDear Symplified,  At salesforce.com, trust is a top priority, and we are constantly improving our network to ensure high availability of our service. You are receiving this email because we have identified you as a system administrator of a salesforce.com organization that may be impacted by this change.What is the change? We are enhancing our network by adding additional Internet Protocol (IP) addresses in order to provide you with a more robust and reliable service. These additional IP addresses fall within our existing standard IP range for your instance. If you whitelist specific IP addresses for your salesforce.com or Sandbox instance, you will need to update your settings to include the standard range for your instance. You can view the standard ranges in Knowledge Article Number 102757: https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewSolution?language=en&id=102757(You will have to log in using your salesforce.com credentials for security purposes.)When is this change taking effect? The additional IP addresses will be added beginning November 10, 2011.What action do I need to take? If you whitelist specific IP addresses for your salesforce.com or Sandbox instance, you will need to update your settings to include the standard range for your instance. If you do not take this action, then you will begin to experience intermittent disruptions when connecting to the salesforce.com application once these new IP addresses are added on November 10, 2011. If your organization does not whitelist or restrict salesforce.com access to certain IP addresses, then no action is required and you will not be impacted by this change. Why are we making this change? We are adding additional IP addresses to add redundancy to our network in order to increase capacity and resiliency, allowing us to provide you with a reliable and robust service.How can I get more information? Please refer to the Knowledge Base article noted above for more information regarding salesforce.com IP addresses.Please contact Customer Support for further questions you may have.Best regards, salesforce.com Customer Support Copyright 2000-2011 salesforce.com - All rights reserved.

I was only able to login a few times for a short period of time last Tuesday (10/11/2011) at around 11:30am. I had first tried Jessica’s test account that she sent, which worked. I then logged out and tried my account, which worked as well for the first time. I then turned off my wireless to force my phone over 3G and logged in, but then had the issue. I switched back-n-forth between on and off wireless with the same working and not working results. These tests were all pointed to our IDRs in Phoenix using their public load balanced IP address. I think I then tested connecting to our San Diego IDR on net, but that failed. These results led me to think maybe one of the IDRs was working correctly in Phx, but because of the load balancer I didn’t know which one. I was hoping to figure that out with some additional testing on 10/14 and 10/18, but all my tests failed and I was never able to get another successful login that kicked me back to the thick client interface. I’ve tested Jessica’s test account multiple times without any issues. We also have not had any login issues with the desktop client, so it seems mobile client specific.Let me know if you need any other info.Thanks,JohnFrom: David Lumpkin [mailto:dlumpkin@symplified.com] Sent: Tuesday, October 18, 2011 1:48 PMTo: Herring, JohnCc: Jessica Tong; Lenore Tumey; molly@box.net; Baughn, Jeff; McWethy, CameronSubject: Re: Box.net mobile clientHi John,All your IDRs are definitely on the latest version, but its possible that the different networks could be causing issues with the redirect.

I’ve tried various tests, forcing my client to connect to specific IDRs on and off network, but every test has had the same issue. The only test I cannot perform is taking the load balancer out of the picture for the IDRs in Phoenix due to the way the network config was architected there. I was able to do this in San Diego, but still had the issue. If you could please check our IDR configurations to make sure they are updated and properly configured to support the mobile clients and get back to us as soon as possible, I would greatly appreciate it.

I tested logging in from my iPad’s Box.net app using the “More login options” which brings me to the SSO Login page. I put in my Box.net user name and am redirected to our Symplified login page. I enter my network credentials there at which point I am then redirected to our Symplified web portal where I can click on links to our available apps, including Box.net. Clicking on Box.net takes me to the mobile web version of my Box.net account. I am never returned to the thick app’s interface for accessing my files, which is what I assumed would happen and is what Todd Stewart was shown a demo of. Todd was also informed that with the OAuth integration we would not need to enter our credentials for Symplified each time we use the app, that it would utilize tokens to verify access on the backend. Currently I have to enter in credentials for Symplified each time I use my thick app which makes for a long process and doesn’t give me the added features of the thick app. I’m not sure the issue is due to a lack of support on the thick app, our Box.net configuration, our Symplified configuration, or a combination of things. Would you please have your resources to look into this. If you need any additional information, please let me know. We could also setup a conference call so we can all discuss together if you feel it would be helpful.

Typically, when a user can sign in to sso, but cannot sign in to Salesforce.com, we see an error in the Salesforce.com log. In this case, we're not seeing anything at all logged in Salesforce.com for this user, which makes me think sso is never hitting Salesforce.com for this user. What do you think?

It seems you have to configure a User Store that the SAML assertion will map into, and I assume you take the subjectID and you look up that UserStore to see if the user is in that store. And the way you check the user store is through a server-to-server connection, not re-bounce it through front-end connection via SAML, correct?And if there are additional attributes in a SAML assertion that you want to use for access policy settings, then you will need to map the attributes in the SAML assertion to a user store's own attributes, and then use the user store's attributes list to create the policies, correct?Further, if you don't want the user store to be your own user store, you can use a remote user store, as long as 1) you can connect to it via AD, LDAP, or WebServices, or in case of Google and SalesForce, you have created special user store connectors to connect to them, correct?And if you want to pass any SAML attributes in the assertion to any downstream SaaS applications, you can map the attributes to a user store's attributes, and then pass the user store attributes as trusted header to the downstream SaaS application, correct?",2011-12-06 05:06:00,2011-12-08 06:05:00,"gary_krall@symantec.com","Symantec Corporation","ltumey@symplified.com","question","closed","normal",

3504,"Two Issues","Shaun, after reviewing an issue with SSO authentication for external IDR users, it appears all of the customizations I made to the External IDR config were reverted at 11AM on Dec. 10th… I do not know how or why that happened, but it completely broke the authentication handling on the IDR. The “username_short” attribute I added to our userstore settings was lost (even though it is being correctly reported by the userstore web service), as were all of the changes made to the SimPL application settings instructing it to use this attribute, as well as the access policy. Do you know what could have caused this? I have re-added the customizations required to the IDR config and published it. It is working now, and this resolved all the issues as far as I can tell – but since I do not know how the configuration was reverted I don’t know if it will happen again or not… Tyler – ignore the email I sent about the 2 users. That was due to the above issue which was not related to SimPL. However, I did find another issue with the session handling in SimPL while troubleshooting this. It appears that even on an unsuccessful login attempt to SimPL a session of some sort is created and is maintained (using a cookie perhaps, not sure). This creates the following problem: 1. A user logs into our portal and clicks the SSO link to access SimpL (call this user X).2. For whatever reason the login fails (user does not exist in SimPL, for example).3. User logs out of our portal and another user logs into it (user Y) on the same machine. It is now impossible for the 2nd user to access SimPL - because it doesn’t release the session from the first failed login attempt… It simply keeps reporting that user X could not be authenticated, even though user X is not the person attempting to access SimPL any longer. Releasing the session on logout does not fix this, since there is actually no logged in user to speak of… I do not know what is required to do this in the SimPL system, but upon a failed login attempt the current “session” need to be nullified (or better yet do not create it until after authentication is successful if possible). Krist and Keith – As of right now the SSO between the provider portal and SimPL is working correctly for all external IDR users (with the exception of the issue with session handling, but that does not affect successful logins) Heath ProvostWeb DeveloperSchumacher Group",2011-12-13 08:47:00,2012-01-03 09:18:00,"heath_provost@schumachergroup.com","Schumacher Group","sfeaker@symplified.com","question","closed","normal",

On page 2, step 2 of singlepoint-idr-cli-reference.pdf: The document says to set environment variable SWS_HOME to the path of the API directory. In my testing this appears to actually be SWS_SDK_HOME. It is referenced as SWS_HOME throughout the document and README.txt. When calling the command with SDK_HOME, the script returns the following result:SWS_SDK_HOME environment variable was not set correctly. This variable should be the directory name where you installed the SDK.In viewing all the bash and windows scripts, it is clear that this variable is the one being expected, NOT SWS_HOME.2. Step 7 of the PDF says to test the installation by running sws --version . There is no sws command in the bin directory. There is an idr command, and running idr --version produces the expected output (9.0). The README.txt refers to idr.Running the sws command simply returns an error from the operating system that the binary was not found.""-bash: sws: command not found""3.

3599,"Changes in Google Docs Integration with Salesforce","You are receiving this email because our records indicate you are an administrator of a Salesforce CRM Org.  Org ID: 00D500000007EiF  Product & Service Notification Dear Symplified, At salesforce.com, trust is our top priority, and it is our goal to ensure that any changes we make have a minimal impact on your business processes. You are receiving this email because we have identified you as a system administrator of a salesforce.com organization that is impacted by an upcoming change to Google Docs integration with Salesforce.What is changing?  Google is constantly changing and evolving their technology infrastructure. As a result of one of these changes, we have recently learned that the Salesforce “Google Docs” tab will no longer function as of January 5, 2012. All other Google Docs integrations within Salesforce (i.e. Attachments to Salesforce records, and Salesforce CRM Content) are not affected by this change.What is the Salesforce “Google Docs” tab? The Google Docs tab allows users to access their Google Docs account from within Salesforce. This tab can be turned on by the system administrator under Setup->Google Apps->Settings. Once it is turned on, individual users can add the tab to their Salesforce interface.The tab relies on a piece of functionality provided by Google called the “Google DocList gadget”. The Google DocList gadget was part of the Google Labs program. Google decided to phase out their Google Labs program and officially announced that decision on September 11, 2011. In early December, Salesforce received notice that the DocList gadget would be retired, and that the Salesforce Google Docs tab would no longer function as of January 5, 2012. What is the impact on my organization and users? On January 5, 2012, Salesforce users who access the Google Docs tab will see an error message indicating that the tab is no longer working. To minimize any inconvenience to the user, we are providing within the error message a link that the user can simply click to log directly into Google Docs. What action must I take? No action is required. If you wish, you can turn off the Google Docs tab for all your users.How can I get more information? For general information on Google docs functionality within Salesforce, please go to Salesforce help and search for “Using Google Docs in Salesforce”. Note that it is only the first bullet point on this help page that is being affected. Please contact Customer Support for more information on this specific change.

The reason we fail these requests is to avoid replay attacks which would be an attempt by a hacker to capture the request in transit and then resend it to gain access to the system. We can’t relax this behavior. We don’t support multiple windows / tabs for the same user which be why your first use case is failing. We have never seen the problem described in the 2nd bullet before. I don’t think it is related to setup on our side. As far as production goes, it will be a quick change in settings on my side to change the URL to the production org in KHub. We do have to ensure that each PersID in your system exists in our system or else SSO will fail. I suggest sending us a dump 1 week before production in the format that Damon previously provided so we can compare accounts between systems and create what accounts we need to create.

If so, what and who should be following up? Also, wanted to let you know that we plan to go live on January 10th.

When we are going through Symplified, and when we are in Socialtext, if I try to Create a page and save the page, it gives and error message saying the page already exists – even though there is no page by that name. It does not matter what page name we provide, the error message is the same. As a way of debugging Socialtext suggested that we bypass Symplified and then try the same process. Accordingly I put in the host IP of Socialtext appliance in my host file and did the same process. I did not get the error this time. So this indicates that somehow Symplified is causing some script to fail which is causing this issue in Socialtext.This is an extremely high priority issue for us now as no one is able to save any pages or create any pages in Socialtext.

3685,"Ldap authentication","Hi,I work with Ashish at Visiting Service of New York and had a question regarding alternative authentication models. We currently use you for saml authentication and I wanted to know if you also do simple ldap authentication. We have a vendor looking to authenticate some of our users into their app and they would like to talk directory to our active directory infrastructure over ldap, of course we would prefer some degree of buffering between us and outside parties. This vendor handles authentication into their app by using the users credentials to attempt a successful ldap bind, and hence authenticating. Could simplified fit anywhere in that picture?Thank you.",2012-01-18 04:37:00,2012-02-01 05:39:00,"Aristides.Taveras@vnsny.org","Visiting Nurse Service of NY","rratkiewicz@symplified.com","question","closed","normal",

Instead, I get redirected back to the login page (under the protected URL). Behind the scenes, it looks like the POST URL includes a JSESSIONID. I've tried removing that in the trust connector, but still have no luck. I suspect we need to actually pass this through from the cookie that's set. There are some details in the thread below on how the developer/admin says the authentication piece is supposed to work.I'm hoping someone in Dev can give me a hand with getting this working, either with the Trust Connector or with a different adapter if one exists that does this. I've got some Live HTTP Headers output and screenshots, and will upload them to this Parature ticket. Start with the Word doc, then reference the headers files mentioned for each use case.

Basically, if a custom portal landing page or other protected h-fed resource didn't have a favicon, and a user attempted to request that resource before having established a session with the IDR, they'd get sent to the defined error page instead of the requested/landing page because the IDR would detect the 404 not found and interpret that as an error. This was a pain to diagnose because there wasn't anything in the logs really indicating why a user was suddenly at the error page, and we pretty much had to use tools like HttpFox to figure out that the browser's request for a not-present favicon.ico file was what triggered this. Despite the notes in Parature 16057-3067, this favicon behavior has not changed.The workaround has been to ask the web server admin to install a favicon, but this is brittle, and customers (Zurich) are concerned that if one web server admin misses this, it could lead to a really unpleasant user experience.",2012-02-03 05:40:00,2012-02-22 12:37:00,"ltumey@symplified.com","Symplified, Inc.","ltumey@symplified.com","problem","closed","normal",

Ericom (the vendor) created a custom login page that accepts the following:AD usernameAD passwordAD domainAS400 usernameAS400 passwordOnly the AD username, password, and domain are required to log into the Ericom website, but if the AS400 username and password are set, they'll be put into a cookie which is then passed to the AS400 client so the user doesn't have to manually enter in their AS400 credentials.This application discovers fine with the Trust Connector, and SSO into the AS400 system works using this workflow, but since we can only support one 'password' (everything else is cleartext in the portal as well as in the keychain CLI), this is not a good fit. We can't have AS400 passwords be visible. Rather than rework the keychain handling for this one use case, Topher had an idea of creating a custom adapter for the AS400 piece that would populate the required cookie with the AS400 creds a user would enter in their keychain and launch the AS400 client directly. This would also allow us to create multiple AS400 environment 'applications' so a user could launch the one they want right from the ribbon.Because this is an internal-only application, I have collected Charles proxy output from the login ceremony (attached). I can also provide the html from the Ericom login or landing pages if needed.It looks to me like we'll need an adapter to allow for at least the following variables:- Keychain entries for the AS400 username & password, mapping to customizable cookie entry (e.g. IBMinfo=IBMUser...)- AS400 Connection Type (e.g. 5)- AS400 Connection Name (e.g. AS400_FF)We may also need something to accommodate these, if we won't be using a separate Trust Connector app:- URL to Ericom login page- URL to Ericom landing page (not sure if this is needed)- Keychain for AD username, password, & domain (if we could do sso passthru for this, that'd be best!)Please let me know if you need anything else to be able to start development of this adapter.",2012-02-06 03:37:00,2012-02-22 12:42:00,"ltumey@symplified.com","Symplified, Inc.","ltumey@symplified.com","task","closed","urgent",

3827,"HA IDRs redirecting to their own hostnames instead of to VIP portal/login pages","I've been seeing some strange (but unfortunately intermittent) behavior related to HA configurations.Rambus Dev and Rambus Prod are both configured for HA, with load balancers and NFS and configured VIPs. For the last several days, Rambus Dev was working fine, but Rambus Prod was redirecting any user requests that were going to the vip (https://login.rambus.com) to the IDR's own hostname (e.g. https://bcxsv-sso2.rambus.com/portal/ribbon/portal.html). I checked and double-checked the configs. Disabled/published/re-configured/published the HA settings. Still no luck. Then I cleared the cache, etc. using ops' /usr/local/bin/IDRConfigRefresh.sh script, which does the following:Stop the tomcat serviceRemove the xml files from /usr/local/symplified/cacheRemove the mavenrepoRemove the contents of the temp and work folders from /usr/local/symplified/apache-tomcatAnd will restart the tomcat service when done.Then, things magically started working! User requests now stay at the login.rambus.com hostname as they should. FYI, I took a bundlelogs on their 2nd prod IDR before and after running the IDRConfigRefresh.sh script. A bit later, we were working with them on their Dev environment. Their admin was in studio fiddling with the default portal background page settings and published the changes. At about the same time, we noticed that the Dev IDR had started behaving badly with hostname handling (users who were trying to open up https://login.rambuspc.com were getting redirected to the Dev IDR hostname, hqxsv-ssodev1.rambuspc.com). I tried using the same cache-clearing script, but this time it had no effect. Then Ryan tried it and also restarted singlepoint services after running the cache-clearing script, and things started working correctly again.All of their IDRs seem to be behaving correctly right now, but I'm not feeling confident that they should go live until we figure out what's going on. The load balancer name (VIP) for the Prod environment is login.rambus.com. Both the ""before-bad"" and ""after-ok"" versions of the customer.xml contain this name in two lines. The first is: <loadBalancerName>login.rambus.com</loadBalancerName>The second is a really long blob that I believe is related to the New IWA configuration (the SP url includes the VIP hostname):""https://login.rambus.com/SPServlet?sp_id\\\\\\\\u003daj0fa40dqbi4\\\\\\\""The bundlelogs are on tigger -- https://tigger.symplified.net/logdrop/before-bad: https://tigger.symplified.net/logdrop/symplified_bcxsv-sso2.rambus.com_2012-02-22_13-01-13.tar.gzafter-ok: https://tigger.symplified.net/logdrop/symplified_bcxsv-sso2.rambus.com_2012-02-22_13-04-20.tar.gzIt sounds like maybe the configuration is being pushed down, but somehow the httpd.conf is not being written out correctly? Both before and after, it contained this:<VirtualHost 10.60.20.157:443> ServerName bcxsv-sso2.rambus.com ServerAlias bcxsv-sso2.rambus.comNote that both names are the same, which Max indicates is not correct.The only other unique things about their configuration are that:1) They're using ""new IWA"" (configured as auto authN source) in both Prod and Dev2) Their prod environment has the two HA IDRs located in different datacenters (both are mounting the same NFS share, though)3) Their dev environment has just one IDR, but it is behind a load balancer w/ VIP and is using NFS to be as close to the prod configuration as possible.4) Their prod environment doesn't yet have any applications configured.",2012-02-24 05:47:00,2012-09-14 03:23:00,"ltumey@symplified.com","Symplified, Inc.","ops@symplified.com","problem","open","normal","Other,Problem Report,Bug - Possible New"

We were hoping to be able to use the Box Sync product which allows you to drag and drop files from your computer into Box.net, but we&#8217;re running into an issue where we can&#8217;t get Box Sync to connect through SSO. There are a couple symptoms depending on your OS. In Windows 7, when you install Box Sync and try to connect for the first time, you choose login through SSO and the application tries to connect but eventually fails saying there&#8217;s no connection to the internet. If you use Mac, you again choose SSO and it pops up a window with the Symplified portal, you put in your credentials and it says it&#8217;s logging you in, then the window goes away and the Box Sync eventually times out and also says failed to connect. I&#8217;ve attached screen shots of both occurrences. Does Symplified support this feature of Box.net?

The features are not recorded in the 32-bit section of the registry, only the 64-bit portion.The following workaround will allow you to install the connector:1. Confirm that you have actually installed the necessary components (.NET 4.0, IIS 7, Windows Authentication, IIS 6 Metabase)2.

The credentials could then easily passed to QA for monitoring customer applications, rather than requesting SD obtain them from the customer.2. A customer administrator can easily change a test credential if they so need to (think customer turnover)3. If discovery of an H-Fed application fails and requires an Engineering resource, a test credential is already entered into Studio, and Engineering should have the information they need to proceed on testing/building a custom adapter.

During this time, the salesforce.com NA2 service will be unavailable. Users attempting to access the service during this time will be presented with a scheduled maintenance notification page. How will this change impact my organization?If your organization whitelists IP addresses, please review the following article to add the IP addresses for the new data center: What salesforce.com network IP addresses do I need to whitelist? (https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewSolution?id=000003652&language=en_US)  This move will not change the instance (NA2) on which your service resides, nor will it impact the standard maintenance window or release window for the NA2 instance.

He found that his browser was caching certain of the IDR pages, which meant that instead of winding up back at the login screen after his application inactivity timeout redirected the user back to the IdPServlet URL, his browser instead re-POSTed the old assertion to the ACS URL. He found that if he changed his browser settings to not cache anything, the behavior was as expected, and the user wound up back at the IDR login screen after the timeout.Terry proposed that we add <META HTTP-EQUIV=""PRAGMA"" CONTENT=""NO-CACHE""> in the head section of the IdPServlet to fix this problem. I suspect that we may also want to add it to the LoginServlet.Ravinder has been forwarded the email thread with screenshots and additional details (Subject: Fw: Cookie/Session Timeout)",2012-05-02 11:25:00,2012-09-14 03:34:00,"ltumey@symplified.com","Symplified, Inc.","ops@symplified.com","problem","open","normal","Email,Problem Report,Bug - Possible New"

4150,"Problem with Date Header Format using .NET to Access WebService API","The IDR is throwing a 500 error when I try to submit a webservice request. The exception is shown below.

I&#39;m able to modify the requestDate in thesignature to match the format required by the webservice.The date header produced by .NET is standard according to several RFCs(822,1123.2616), although I&#39;m not sure how closely these standards areadhered to. The format produced by .NET is:""Tue, 08 May 2012 20:33:54 GMT""The format required by the webservice is:""Tue, 08-May-12 14:15:54 -0500"";Here&#39;s some info on the restrictions imposed by .NET on setting headershttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.webclient.headers.aspxSo, we can change the DATE to another value, we just can&#39;t change the format of the date when it is passed in the request.The best solution would be for the webservice to be able to parse either date format.Tony: [ajp-bio-8009-exec-9] ERROR com.symplified.application.appliance.api.authentication.RestAuthenticationInInterceptor[167] - Unable to parse date ""Tue, 08 May 2012 20:33:54 GMT""com.symplified.platform.webservice.WebServiceApiException: code=INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR,detail=Unable to parse date ""Tue, 08 May 2012 20:33:54 GMT""at com.symplified.platform.webservice.WebServiceApiSecurityUtils.verifyRequest(WebServiceApiSecurityUtils.java:217)at com.symplified.application.appliance.api.authentication.RestAuthenticationInInterceptor.handleMessage(RestAuthenticationInInterceptor.java:162)at org.apache.cxf.phase.PhaseInterceptorChain.doIntercept(PhaseInterceptorChain.java:243)at org.apache.cxf.transport.ChainInitiationObserver.onMessage(ChainInitiationObserver.java:111)at org.apache.cxf.transport.servlet.ServletDestination.invoke(ServletDestination.java:99)at org.apache.cxf.transport.servlet.ServletController.invokeDestination(ServletController.java:428)at org.apache.cxf.transport.servlet.ServletController.invoke(ServletController.java:144)at org.apache.cxf.transport.servlet.AbstractCXFServlet.invoke(AbstractCXFServlet.java:148)at org.apache.cxf.transport.servlet.AbstractHTTPServlet.handleRequest(AbstractHTTPServlet.java:179)at org.apache.cxf.transport.servlet.AbstractHTTPServlet.doGet(AbstractHTTPServlet.java:108)at javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:621)at org.apache.cxf.transport.servlet.AbstractHTTPServlet.service(AbstractHTTPServlet.java:159)at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.internalDoFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:305)at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.doFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:210)at com.symplified.application.appliance.DisableSessionUrlFilter.doFilter(DisableSessionUrlFilter.java:66)at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.internalDoFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:243)at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.doFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:210)at org.springframework.web.filter.CharacterEncodingFilter.doFilterInternal(CharacterEncodingFilter.java:88)at org.springframework.web.filter.OncePerRequestFilter.doFilter(OncePerRequestFilter.java:76)at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.internalDoFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:243)at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.doFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:210)at com.symplified.application.appliance.InjectionScrubFilter.doFilter(InjectionScrubFilter.java:39)at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.internalDoFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:243)at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.doFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:210)at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardWrapperValve.invoke(StandardWrapperValve.java:224)at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardContextValve.invoke(StandardContextValve.java:169)at org.apache.catalina.authenticator.AuthenticatorBase.invoke(AuthenticatorBase.java:472)at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardHostValve.invoke(StandardHostValve.java:168)at org.apache.catalina.valves.ErrorReportValve.invoke(ErrorReportValve.java:98)at org.apache.catalina.valves.AccessLogValve.invoke(AccessLogValve.java:928)at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardEngineValve.invoke(StandardEngineValve.java:118)at org.apache.catalina.connector.CoyoteAdapter.service(CoyoteAdapter.java:407)at org.apache.coyote.ajp.AjpProcessor.process(AjpProcessor.java:200)at org.apache.coyote.AbstractProtocol$AbstractConnectionHandler.process(AbstractProtocol.java:539)at org.apache.tomcat.util.net.JIoEndpoint$SocketProcessor.run(JIoEndpoint.java:298)at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1110)at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:603)at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:722)-- Tony--Tony SalernoSolutions ArchitectICSynergy International, LPMobile: (972) 740-4669tony.salerno@icsynergy.comhttp://www.icsynergy.comPlease open the attachment to view the entire email.",2012-05-08 06:10:00,2012-05-10 07:21:00,"tony.salerno@icsynergy.com","ICSynergy International, LP.","dlumpkin@symplified.com","problem","closed","normal",

This will allow us to integrate via automatic redirect to all IdP's. I have used HTTP-Fox's Tamper Data extension to confirm that by changing this attribute to IsPassive=”false” results in the correct authentication.

The problem is that the hash password synchs back into the data store the Store http Federate connections uses for Authentication and will not be able to update the keychain through the Symplified cli accordingly. Even if it does update the keychain it will be with the hash value and the user would not know this value. Any thoughts on how companies work around this issue?

See below for their updated URLs. I tried to set up a new generic SAML adapter configured in the same fashion as the working Live Office Dev connector. Something isn’t quite right with it. Maybe I made a mistake. Attempts to authenticate don’t work.

At the moment, there is nothing on the roadmap to have this behaviour changed.Now here are the Pros and Cons:Pros1. We can verify the new SSO configuration changes in your production environment, prior to rolling it out to users.2. There will be no interruption in user access for those users using the non-SSO URL.3. You can selectively role out the new SSO URL to your users.Cons1. User Management – You will need to continue to manually manage your user’s identities in the cloud, unless you adopt the use of our on-premise CloudLink tool.I’ll keep you updated on our progress.

His email is alin_mutu@symantec.com. WE would need to get this straightened out before he goes back to the customer tomorrow late morning.-----Hi guys, I ran into an issue with the TrustFabric WebEx connector today. Configured in “SP initiated” mode, it crashes the O3 IdP servlet. I am doing this for KLA-Tencor as part of their evaluation. I was able to make it work with the generic SAML connector, so I can move this opportunity forward. However, someone should look into this and get back to me with either a defect confirmation or a different configuration that works, before I hand this over to the customer tomorrow afternoon. I attached both the broken configuration as well as the working one based on the generic SAML connector to compare and contrast, as well as the end-user error and the gateway log extract. Note that the only change on the SP side is the Idp ID and URL, everything else is identical including the test users. I am available tonight and tomorrow morning if you’d like to see this reproduced. The customer’s O3 environment (ea50) has both IdPs/connectors configured, but the SP is configured to use the working generic SAML connector right now. I’ll be changing the configuration later to look for the mail attribute in AD instead of department as I define some KLA specific test users, but that will not impact this behaviour. I wanted to route this through you so you can get a better handle on a scalable escalation process moving forward, this is going to be painful if we keep using e-mail and individuals as points of contacts. I can use the connectors DL, but I don’t know if that is the right path either as it could just raise unnecessary red flags.

You will need to perform a publish to make sure it is changed on the IdR and the end users see the update. Let me know if you have any other questions.

In the connector I created a Policy to allow members of the FLC Dev AD Group to see the link. I believe my issue is with the Configuraton tab - Attributes subtab, or within the Policy I set up in the connector. When I currently go to our URL I am able to log on with the test ID. I should then be taken to the landing page (portal.jsp) and see all of the links that the test account should have access to which is currently just FLC Dev. I do not get any links I get the following error message - Access DeniedYou are not authorized to view the page that was requested.The URL changes to error.jsp and on the end of it shows singlepoint-auth-error=DENY&singlepoint-portal-event=app-unauthorized.

When she tried to do this, she would get a ""Unexpected Error (E27132523)"" in studio.We tracked this down to a problem in the logic -- studio was trying to pull a hostname to use (presumably for the IdP URL), and was just looking in the database for an IDR hostname. Unfortunately, Zurich is an HA environment and had an IDR object for a DR IDR that had never called home, so (we presume) that field was not populated. When I deleted that IDR object from studio, I was then able to create a new SAML application.NOTE: In an HA environment, we should NOT be populating these SAML URLs with an individual IDR hostname, anyway -- it should be using the VIP name (Edit profile >> IDR clustering >> Load Balancer DNS Name).The corresponding stack trace that ops found in the logs [SymOps #1037] was this:WARN com.symplified.application.admin.PolicyOwnerServiceImpl[1100] - Thehandler Saml2GenericDirectPost specifies a default menu server which does nothave a coresponding default application server.

I do know that sAMAccount is used in multipel authz policies, and specifically in one of the SAML connectors (Google). There the policy is setup that if sAMAaccount contains a value that is ""one of"" a list, then the access is permitted. The ""being one of"" is setup through member-of-list policy UI as described in the policy documentation (see attached).This policy functionally works and the yellow highlight didn't show up until this past weekend.RK",2012-07-16 03:45:00,2012-09-28 03:24:00,"rob_koeten@symantec.com","Symantec Corporation","jmcfarland@symplified.com","problem","closed","normal",

We strive to continually update and enhance our product in response to both user requests as well as developments in the IAM space, and the Summer 2012 release is reflective of this work. This product release contains a number of improvements and new features, and we&#8217;d like to point out some of the most notable of these below:Step-Up Re-Authentication: Administrators can now set group and application-based policies that require users to re-authenticate themselves in order to access a particular application even if they&#8217;ve already provided credentials or an OTP.CryptoCard: Added support for CryptoCard&#8217;s strong-authentication OTP service via a new solution adapter. Custom Portal: Administrators with custom portals can now discern between logouts based on active user logout requests and passive time-out session closes. Cipher Rotation: Customer administrators for studio can now perform and schedule cipher rotation for their customers based upon their security policies.IDR Clustering: Added capability that allows users to set up High Availability (HA) architectures and fail-over to a disaster recovery site.This now allows for HA deployments in the Amazon environmentThere is no longer an HA requirement for a NFS/CIFS serverThe new HA architecture increases access/write speeds when creating user profiles.Session replication within the cluster is enabledPlease consult online documentation or contactCustomer Support for more information on the above enhancements.

Currently our implementation has two IDRs within the same DMZ and subnet. I am guessing that we do not need to worry about these port since these devices are behind the same firewall and there is no firewall seperating them?Question two is about our future setup for a DR IDR. We have been waiting internally for the correct Storage to be setup in our DR location so we can replicate the shared storage between Data Centers. Since this will no longer be a requirement how can we move forward with configuring our DR location after this release is deployed? I am guessing that this is when we will need those ports open between our DMZs in different data centers?Thanks,Scott ",2012-07-19 12:01:00,2012-07-26 07:34:00,"scott.hadden@biogenidec.com","Biogen Idec Inc.","dlumpkin@symplified.com","question","closed","low",

4441,"IDR SPServlet does not respect RelayState","When a 9.3 IDR receives a SAML message with a RelayState POST parameter, the POST parameter is not followed. Instead the IDR redirects the user to the next-redirect url associated with the session cookie.Allegedly in 9.2 the SPServlet would process the RelayState parameter and redirect the user accordingly. I do not have a 9.2 environment available to test with however.The workflows that this affects are as follows:1. SP Initiated (ex. IWA Connector) - If a user somehow loses their session cookie during the redirect to the SAML IDP they will be returned to the portal page instead of the link originally requested.2. IDP Initiated (ex. One IDR configured to POST SAML to another IDR with a Target Resource) - If a SAML IDP spontaneously posts a SAML assertion to an IDR it will always redirect the user to the portal page and will not respect the RelayState specified (via the Target Resource in this example)",2012-07-23 02:31:00,2012-07-23 05:26:00,"dlumpkin@symplified.com","Symplified, Inc.","ops@symplified.com","problem","open","normal",

4448,"Zurich broken portal: singlepoint cookie no longer passed to applications via header?","It looks like in 9.3, we no longer pass the singlepoint cookie in the Cookie header that we send to protected No-AuthN applications (such as the custom portal). Zurich has many applications that have been looking for this header, including their custom portal. Zurich has a testpage.aspx page that displays all the headers passed to it. In 9.2, it looked like this: Cookie = SPBALANCEID=balancer.10.148.72.99; ASP.NET_SessionId=fm0l1y2nft5eujwrpqzxhxuy; singlepoint=74ef91ac-120b-4fd1-8029-7081348ee1bcin 9.3:  Cookie = SPBALANCEID=balancer.10.148.72.99; ASP.NET_SessionId=i3t4tvbz24qruygtexpa3sfj;Zurich has been using this cookie-check to help ensure that end-users aren't circumventing the IDR and going directly to the back-end webservers (an option that Linda said Max offered as an alternative to network/firewall restrictions to the backend webserver, way back in the early design days).What can we do to make the IDR send the singlepoint cookie in the header, again? Could we use custom headers in some way, or will this require a patch?Note that although this is a ""test"" environment, Zurich is in the final stages of their UAT and planning to go live with their applications in Production on 8/3, so this needs to be treated as a high priority issue.FYI - In the Zurich Dev environment, we worked around the 400 server errors I mentioned in my email last night by upping the limit on their IIS server. In the Zurich Test (QA) environment, even that IIS config change wasn't enough to accommodate their ~100 application URLs. There, we wound up unchecking ""pass headers"" since their custom portal isn't consuming the x-singlepoint-applications header for any dynamic app list displaying.",2012-07-25 10:10:00,2012-09-05 12:25:00,"ltumey@symplified.com","Symplified, Inc.","ops@symplified.com","problem","open","high","Internal,Problem Report,Bug - Possible New"

However, we need to make sure that all of you can login to the Spring CM UAT environment (link below), using your AD (Active Directory) account – which is using your “Employee ID and Password”. Before you login for the first time, you must “activate” your account in Spring CM using the link that was sent to you either by Stacy from Spring CM or Lisa Masters. Once this is done, please click the UAT Test link below and login.SpringcmUAT.scrippsnetworks.comOnce in the application, please “bang around” and become familiar with all of the screens and functionality. You cannot break anything! This evening, Stacey (with Spring CM) plans to do a cleansing of the UAT environment so that the users have a clean environment for the “formal” UAT testing phase. Therefore, any activity done today will be wiped out and we will start with a clean slate for UAT Testing. Also, the Test Plan will detail ‘step by step’ instructions on how to perform your basic testing.I know that several of you are still having trouble getting in the Application using your AD credentials.

The frequency of this problem appears to be increasing and that is bringing a lot of negative attention to our SSO solution.

But I'm unsure what this should be if different from what it is now.I've attached their metadata file which contains some of their location URLs. We are due to launch this adapter August 8th and up until now, I had thought it was working correctly, but their response on the email URLs has thrown me somewhat. An easy workaround perhaps would be to ask them to remove the URLs that are in the email completely, but I do know that some of our more executive employees use them for launching directlry into their task, rather than launching the main URL and finding their task through their daskboard/menu optionsCan you help?Thanks,Bernard.",2012-07-30 01:10:00,2012-09-14 03:22:00,"bernard.sheridan@elan.com","Elan Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","dlumpkin@symplified.com","question","closed","normal",

4535,"SimpleLink race condition","Tracking in Parature for visibility. Email from Colin 8/4/2012:The issue DWR was having I believe stems from the slower processing up at EC2. When ""service simplelink stop"" is issued as part of a publish with a SimpleLink configuration, the actual openvpn process and kernel need to cleanup tun1 and this seems to take a non-trivial amount of time on an AMI. Since the service stop call returns quickly even though the kernel may not have disseminated the interface yet, we get into a race-condition of sorts when we do our system calls to ""/sbin/ifconfig -a"" to find ip information.

On my KVM IDR I can get this to show up occasionally with repeated restarts, but I would wager on an AMI it shows up basically every time.This race behaviour was observed at a different point in the SimpleLink service during publish time, noted in Mantis 4671.The temporary fix for DWR was to make the ""service simplelink stop"" command take longer, so that the kernel could completely remove tun1 before we try to interact with ifconfig. This fix will persist until an update is made to the singlepoint-appliance package on the IDR.I have filed a new bug with this information (Mantis 5208).",2012-08-06 04:27:00,2012-09-13 08:34:00,"ltumey@symplified.com","Symplified, Inc.","ops@symplified.com","problem","open","urgent","Internal,Problem Report,Bug - Possible New"

The libraries that SIMPL uses for this interaction are part of an open-source package that has gone through some upgrades. We need to test that the upgraded code still works as it should before deploying it.Our development team has confirmed that in October of 2011 they worked directly with a support engineer at your provider--Shaun Feaker at Symplified. What Shaun did was set up a ""test connector"" on his development platform that communicated with our development platform. From what we can see, the portal our development platform points at is still available. It just does not recognize the test user we used at the time. It could be that the only thing that needs to be done is contact Symplified and get that test user re-established. However, it might also be necessary that the test-connector needs to be re-created on that end.Once that is in place, we should be able to authenticate back to our development platform once again--with the existing code. After that we can upgrade the code and confirm that things are still working. All of this tied back to Symplified's support Ticket #16057-3127; although they eventually started working directly via email and phone.Please let us know if you have any questions or need more information in order to move forward.Sincerely,Jhoselin Perez-BlancoHCCS - Experts in Healthcare Learning(516)478-4100, x114jperezblanco@hccs.comOur mission at HCCS is to help healthcare institutions survive and thrive by reducing the burden of regulatory requirements and improving the quality of patient care.

In short the scenario follows these steps:- user opens a wrapped email client (iKonic)- user needs to authenticate with O3 (via webview component).- the wrapped email client ""retains"" the O3 session cookie such that it can be shared with other Nukona wrapped apps.- the user clicks on a proxy-URL (deep-link) into DropBox(www-dropbox-com.ea30.symanteco3.com)- The Dropbox deeplink URL opens up in the wrapped browser app (""Safe Browser""); the Nukona wrapper passes the O3 session cookie along with the deeplink URL. Since the O3 session exist, no O3 login is required.- O3 does the authn against Dropbox (again in webview component) and user ends up on the correct Dropbox webpage.- the user closes the Safe-Browser (and terminates the ipad app)- user goes back to the ikonic wrapped email app and clicks once more on the Dropbox deeplink- The Dropbox deeplnk URL opens up in the Safe-Browser (the O3 session cookie is passed again, so no O3 login required), but then Dropbox doesn't recognize the session and the O3-GW doesn'tre-authenticate against Dropbox. End-result is that the user ends up at a proxied web-page that requires the user to login on the dropbox site.Note that the movie takes about 30 secs to start so you can advance to that point.Somewhere the session cookie is getting lost I believe.",2012-08-28 08:14:00,2012-09-14 03:23:00,"gary_krall@symantec.com","Symantec Corporation","dlumpkin@symplified.com","problem","closed","normal",

We need to be able to support this configuration, perhaps by determining an IDR's HA configuration based on a unique identifier (such as the IDR Activation Key) instead of using the IDR's hostname or IP address.Our interim workaround for Zurich's production environment is for us to remove the DR IDR from the customer object, but Zurich is doing DR testing in November and will need the DR IDR to be re-added to the customer object by then.",2012-09-10 05:48:00,2012-09-26 08:03:00,"ltumey@symplified.com","Symplified, Inc.","ops@symplified.com","problem","open","urgent","Internal,Problem Report,Bug - Possible New"

4736,"Reverse Proxy does not respect client's Accept-Encoding header","When a client (browser, applet, etc) makes an HTTP request, is has the option of sending an ""Accept-Encoding"" header that lists different encodings that the client knows how to process. If a server sees this header and finds an encoding in the list that it knows how to use, it can respond with a ""Content-Encoding"" header that describes how the body content is encoded when the client receives it. One of the more common uses is gzip encoding, which compresses the body content of the response to make it smaller to transmit.In Symplified releases 9.3 and earlier, if the IDR doesn't see an Accept-Encoding request header, it will still respond with a Content-Encoding of gzip and an encoded body. Common browsers typically handle this just fine, but it may cause problems for some applets. To force the IDR to respond with no encoding (as expected based on the applet's request), we can configure the following Rewrite Rule for the application: RequestHeader unset Accept-EncodingHowever, if other portions of the application DO expect to use gzip encoding, this is not possible. We can either set gzip (our default) or unset it for no compression (with the rewrite rule), but we SHOULD be honoring the request based on the Accept-Encoding header sent by the client/browser, not overriding it.",2012-09-12 05:13:00,2012-09-12 05:13:00,"ltumey@symplified.com","Symplified, Inc.","ops@symplified.com","problem","new","high","Phone,Problem Report,Bug - Possible New"

4777,"Zurich Followup","As a followup for the outages at Zurich we need the Engineering/QA team to further analyze the logs from the IDRs to try and determine the exact cause of the failure. We know that they were running performance tests right before it failed where they were using a pool of 1500 test users authenticating at roughly 300 users per minute per IDR. Zurich has an intentionally long inactivity timeout, 4 hours, so the sessions continued accumulating until the devices locked up with approximately 50,000 sessions total (they are clustered so this is for both IDRs). We addressed the immediate issue and have both devices back up and running well, but we need to take a look at this so we can avoid such a hard crash in the future.Here are the bundlelogs for both devices (after they came back online) and we can meet to discuss further if you need additional information:https://tigger.symplified.net/logdrop/symplified_my1.zurichna.com_2012-09-16_14-24-27.tar.gzhttps://tigger.symplified.net/logdrop/symplified_my2.zurichna.com_2012-09-17_00-06-43.tar.gz",2012-09-19 07:20:00,2012-09-19 07:20:00,"dlumpkin@symplified.com","Symplified, Inc.","ops@symplified.com","problem","open","high",

4798,"Support request","Howdy, Amylin Pharmaceuticals was purchased in late July by Bristol Myers Squibb. We expect to maintain our existing infrastructure and directory for some undetermined period of time, which may be measured in years versus months. There is a significant amount of integration work going on now to integrate our systems and processes with theirs. I&#8217;d like to schedule a support call to discuss some of the authentication options available to us with your product moving forward. Long term I&#8217;d like to understand how we can leverage using their IDs for access to our current SAML SaaS applications. Direct integration with their directory seems like one approach. Leveraging their existing IdP infrastructure seems like another approach. A third approach might be integrating our applications with more than one IdP, so users coming from Amylin pass through Symplified for auth, and users coming from BMS pass through their IdP. In the shorter term I&#8217;d also like to know what options we have for authenticating BMS identities to Salesforce using our existing delegated authentication connector, or via SAML connector if that is required. There is a business need to grant BMS users access to our Salesforce environment in the next two weeks.

Since Symplfied does not have an existing Shibboleth adapter, they want a custom connector.  We need to provide Bellevue with a proposal to implement the custom connector and configure for their environment. They need to have this done by the end of October at the latest, but hopefully earlier than that. They are working on setting up an EZProxy sandbox environment.1.) Here is a link to the EZProxy Shibboleth integration informationhttp://www.oclc.org/support/documentation/ezproxy/usr/shibboleth.htm 2.) Here is a link to their EZProxy PROD environment with a test id URL: http://www.bellevue.edu/services/library/database-services.aspxUser: 00207367Pass: 1234(FYI I tried using HTTP-FED to integrate, but it didn't work. I think there is a problem since ezproxy is also acting as a proxyto their library services.) 3.) They currently don't use group information for EZProxy authorization, but they have plans to. So, we would need to have the ability to pass the group information as part of the Shibboleth request.We will be using the Shibboleth SP integration. Sympfified will be the IdP. Their PROD environment doesn't use Shibboleth at all, currently. They will setup a Sandbox that enables the Shibboleth SP integration.They are willing to pay for the custom Shibboleth connector.",2012-09-25 12:21:00,2012-11-30 10:10:00,"sfeaker@symplified.com","Symplified","cewing@symplified.com","task","closed","high",

I've just had another try at logging in as one of the test users (ea59user2), and went to use the button to log in to our Mariner7.com system (i.e. one of our HR systems).When I hovered the mouse over the Mariner7 icon, the ""User application-specific credentials"" option was ticked (as per normal), however, the user name field was greyed out. So I wasn't too sure what to try, so I just typed in my password on it's own, and clicked the Mariner7 icon, which sent me through the Mariner7.com website, but just to the Mariner7 log in page.So I then logged out of O3, and logged back in again, and this time when I hovered the mouse over the Mariner7 icon, the user name field was accessible this time but for some strange reason it had my password (instead of my username) already entered in (see attached screen shot - screenshot_01.jpg). So I changed the username to ""jimbo123@ricoh.com.au"", entered the password in as ""ricoh123"" (see attached screen shot - screenshot_02.jpg), and then clicked save.However, when I then hovered the mouse over the Mariner7 icon again, again for some strange reason the username field was populated with ""ricoh123"" (i.e. my password, rather than username).If you could please do a bit of testing/investigation of this issue, I would very much appreciate it, as this seems to me like either possibly a bug in O3, or perhaps some kind of browser/client issue.Thanks in advance.Regards,James______________________________________________________________________James McNatty | IT Systems Engineer | Ricoh Australia Pty LtdPhone:(02) 8977 1180 | Fax:(02) 8977 1170 | Web:ricoh.com.au[cid:_1_0AE0ACF00AE0A3E40018263ACA257A85]Find out more about the Ricoh eco billboard global initiativeRicoh Australia Pty Ltd ( ""Ricoh Australia"")This email is private and confidential to the intended recipient.

An extension of this question, if it supports multiple domains, is if a single IWA can support multiple forests.

Last week the system became unresponsive and would not accept configuration changes. The issues now are the same as last week. One of my colleagues did the reboot. The snapshot seemed to fix some things, but not everything. It allowed configurations to be accepted, though the intermittent logging continued.

The site url that I need to protect is http://servername:port/appname.I configured a new web server in the Intelligence Center using the servername and port and then configured a new application connector to go along with the web server with the appropriate url for the application. And then published the configuration.After that, when we tried to go to the http://servername:port url we were taken through the O3 gateway instead of going directly to the local website. Is this normal behavior?Because this was not the desired behavior, I deleted the web server and application connector configurations and published again.I expected this to stop the undesired behavior and let us go to the site directly, but instead we are still being sent through the O3 gateway.I have flushed my DNS cache and cleared my IE cache multiple times just to make sure it wasn't something on my client.",2012-11-08 04:43:00,2012-11-13 12:55:00,"Robert_Rosa@symantec.com","Symantec Corporation","jmcfarland@symplified.com","problem","closed","normal",

5093,"Issues with SimpleLink in HA","We tested a pair of Identity Links with a single gateway (gw20.tso-cloud.com). The feature doesn’t work as required. In summary, there are two key findings:1. In an HA pair scenario, each IDL has the same route. From a network perspective, the last IDL online gets all of the traffic (this is all based on host routing tables). If the IDL with the route goes offline, the gateway does not detect the state change in any reasonable time frame. Even after 20 minutes, the user store was not accessible. Sometime overnight, the situation corrected itself and the user store was again reachable. I don’t know if this correction occurred by accident or by design.2. Strange problems arose with both IDLs online. The basic TCP connection test from the Identity Link workspace worked fine, but the user store test failed. It’s going to take some deep reading of network dumps to understand what’s happening. This is so unexpected, it would best if somebody else could try to reproduce in a completely different setup.This is separate from the SYMC IT reported issue and was independently reproduced when a pair of identity links are operating. We were careful to verify that both client #1 and #2 worked when operating solo and then when both were operating things broke down.

5137,"Decoding target to relaystate","Below is a email question that was asked by a venodr we are currently working on, Volunteer Match. I believe this is basically deep linking but we are doing IdP so not sure it is possible without any custom work.In going over your configuration, one more detail I'd like to go over - when a user clicks on a VolunteerMatch link, say from a bookmark, or an email, it will take them to our site, and our site will see that they are not authenticated. We redirect them to:https://saaso2lapv01-pi.biogen.com/IdPServlet?idp_id=cdcprnw6do5yWhen they return with their assertion, currently, they will be sent to the homepage after the SAML passes. We can add a parameter to this URL that includes the link they were trying to access, either fully qualified, or relative. Would you like this feature? To summarize:Step #1If that user is unauthenticated we pass them back to Biogen to get authenticated. We send them here, currently: https://saaso2lapv01-pi.biogen.com/IdPServlet?idp_id=cdcprnw6do5yWe could change the URL to something like ""https://saaso2lapv01-pi.biogen.com/IdPServlet?idp_id=cdcprnw6do5y?TARGET_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fbiogenidec.stage.volunteermatch.org%2Fsome_dir%2Fsome_page.jsp%3Fopp_id%3D12345""The ""TARGET_URL"" name above could be configured to whatever you'd like, but you'd need to take its value, decode it and return it as RelayState.Step #2You authenticate the user and then directs them to https://biogenidec.stage.volunteermatch.org/saml/post;POSTing the SAMLResponse and the RelayState of ""https://biogenidec.stage.volunteermatch.org/some_dir/some_page.jsp?opp_id=12345"".Step #3VolunteerMatch processes the SAMLResponse and if all works well the user is authorized and forwarded to the RelayState URL.",2013-01-09 08:02:00,2013-01-09 12:49:00,"scott.hadden@biogenidec.com","Biogen Idec Inc.","jmcfarland@symplified.com","question","closed","normal",

5145,"issue with IWA authentication on 03 hosted gateways","Description of the Issue:Customer has 2 O3 systems: Production and what they call a Sandbox environment, although both O3 Gateways are hosted on Symantec’s production infrastructure. Both accounts have been configured with IdLink and the IWA components.Correct logon behaviour:Corporate domain user (e.g. ‘castromi’) is logged into their AD domain (nead.danet), when visiting the Sandbox O3 Gateway portal they are automatically authenticated via IWA (Integrated Windows Authentication) and have access to the O3 ribbon. Issue to be resolved in this case:When a domain user (e.g. ‘castromi’) visits the Production O3 Gateway portal, it fails to automatically authenticate the user that is already logged into the domain. Instead, the user is prompted to enter his AD credentials: After submitting the AD credentials (the same used in the Sandbox environment), it yields a “Login Failure” message (“Unable to authenticate with the credentials you provided. Please try again”) and the user gets redirected back to the O3 Gateway portal login web page. The resulting browser URL is: https://gw.cloudsso.danone.com/portal/ribbon/login.html?singlepoint-portal-event=auth-failed&singlepoint-auth-error=NOT_AUTHENTICATED&singlepoint-next-redirect=f6f2b6e3a51c60baec84878fafdc5bad7358b0107146cbee1c920e2952bf4c42&singlepoint-error-message=Unable%20to%20authenticate%20using%20the%20credentials%20you%20provided.%20%20Please%20try%20again.Note, however, that the Event viewer logs on the IWA server show that the user has been successfully authenticated:Questions:Why is IWA authentication failing on the production platform?What else can we try to troubleshoot, pin-point and fix the issue?

Removing some of the connectors seems to have brought the field's length within the limits of your server(s).We would like to know what changes were made by Symplified over the weekend that forced your servers to start saying the field was too long. (Most webservers limit the length of header fields via a configuration file).In the future Bellevue University is going to be adding more applications to our SSO Solution. Ss it currently stands having 7 connectors (as we did this weekend) causes the Bad Request errors on Symplified.

5241,"password updates after 90","How can I configure the ribbon to automatically update the AD credentials passed to the application from the ribbon? The effect would be the user would not need to deal with password updates after 90, it would be done by the ribbon behind the scene.. Regards,Rod From: Lenore Tumey [mailto:ltumey@symplified.com] Sent: Monday, February 11, 2013 12:50 PMTo: Copeland, Rod ASubject: Re: Update Hi Rod, HTTP-Federation involves a form post as part of the login to the application. As such, the IDR needs to have the username & password for the application. Typically, this is done via a keychain on the IDR, though we do also have a feature called ""SSO Passthrough"" in which the IDR can use the same credentials that were used to log into the IDR for the HTTP-Fed form post. However, SSO Passthrough only works if users log into the IDR interactively (entering username & password at the login page). When you're using IWA, SSO Passthrough is not an option because the IDR won't see the user's password at any point so it won't be available to POST to an application's login form. With IWA, users would need to enter their AD credentials into their HTTP-Federation application keychains, and would need to update those keychain credentials when they change their AD password. If these are homegrown/internally developed applications, you might see if they could be configured to consume Trusted Headers from the IDR. In this SSO method, the IDR acts as a reverse proxy (as in HTTP-Federation), but instead of performing a form post on the user's behalf, the IDR injects headers into the stream that the application server can consume to check the user's identity.  Another option might be to add (non-SSO) links to the ribbon for these applications. We don't currently have a dedicated feature for this, but you can use the ""No-AuthN"" adapter to add a link. To configure a link in this way, log into SinglePoint Studio and navigate to Applications >> New Trust Connector >> No-AuthN. Enter a Name, the Portal URL (where you want them to land when they click the link) and a Portal Text/Tooltip. Optionally upload an icon (image). When you click ""publish"" you'll likely see a warning that ""Application __ is not associated with any web servers,"" but this is expected. You should be able to click ""Force publish"" to push it through. Note that the IDR will append a URL parameter (?singlepoint-force-sso=true) to the end of the URL, but most applications will just ignore this. If you have any additional questions about our various SSO integration options, please contact our support organization at support@symplified.com, via the support portal, or by phone (link & phone number in my signature, below).Thanks,Lenore--Lenore TumeySr. Solutions EngineerDirect: 303-318-4126Email: ltumey@symplified.comReach Symplified Support here or call: 303-318-4188 option 2Symplified The Cloud Identity Company http://www.symplified.comFollow us on Twitter &#8211; Twitter.com/SymplifiedRead our Blog &#8211; www.symplified.com/blog On Mon, Feb 11, 2013 at 10:52 AM, Copeland, Rod A <Rod.Copeland@chartercom.com> wrote:Is a HTTP-FED trust connector the way to go for this:If the app we&#8217;re integrating with is AD aware, is there a way to pass the AD creds from the ribbon to the app without the user having to initially save them in the ribbon or having to keep updated with the pw changes?

However, we are running into a problem as we try to configure the sync. Please advise on the following comments from Owen:""I believe Single Sign On is conflicting with the authorization step of this application. The configuration should be redirecting the web browser to Google in order to authenticate and authorize the application's connection to Google. As it's trying to do this, I can see in the url that it is then hitting SSO and hanging there until it times out.

5350,"effect of our IWA/IIS server going down","Good afternoon, We have a single windows server that is configured to support IWA for our production Symplified system. We also use it to host a custom background page behind the ribbon in the default portal. Our development environment isn&#8217;t configured for IWA. Since we only have 1 IWA server, what is the expected behavior and end user experience going to be if we took it down for OS patching? Will users simply be presented with the ribbon requiring user/pass be entered manually and the background page would 404? Will there be timeouts that cause a delay to the end user experience? I could shut the server down temporarily to &#8216;see what happens&#8217; but I&#8217;d appreciate your expert opinion. The obvious follow-up question to this is can I stand up a second IWA/IIS box, stick it behind a load balancer with the first IWA/IIS box and during scheduled maintenance just take them offline 1 by 1 thus ensuring no down-time?

5355,"Connecting Office365 and OWA through ADFS to Symplified withsupport of Safenet Security tokens. Best practices.","Dear Symplified Support, Regarding the plans we have around Office365 and OWA with strong authentication in particular, I would like you to ask for a Symplified support statement around the architecture that we have in mind. Current Architecture: 1. Within DSM we have defined an Access Management architecture which is mandatory for all access related topics including Office365. In this architecture we have a central Identity Router from Symplified that acts as a central policy point and as a federation hub.2. ADFS is currently connected to Simplified as an Identity Provider, so from the Internal Network, internal users can authenticate to Symplified connected SP’s through ADFS 2.x via Windows Authentication.3. Outlook Web App is currently connected to our ADFS 2.x System and makes use of one factor authentication (UPN &#43; password) which also applies for ActiveSync and Outlook. At this moment we are not compliant with our security policy that states strong authentication for OWA. Due to organizational/project dependencies we postponed the implementation of OWA strong authentication.4. The relation towards the strong authentication provider is done via Symplified. We are using Safenet (before Cryptocard) for two factor authentication using an OTP. Safenet is deployed as a cloud service, where we pass through the email address as claim along with the OTP. In Exchange Online we make use of UPN’s that are identical to the user’s email address. The standard we use is SAML v2 (between Symplified and all other parties). The picture below depicts the current architecture: cid:image004.png@01CE1F25.B0EE47A0   Proposed architecture:In the proposed architecture we are changing two important items:1. We introduce strong authentication for OWA only. Outlook and ActiveSync will remain one factor (until the application supports it).2. Symplified will be the Identity Provider for ADFS and ADFS will be the IDP-HUB for OWA. The picture below depicts the proposed architecture. cid:image005.png@01CE1F26.27E488B0  Important remark is that AD FS becomes nothing more than a pass-through towards Symplified for the Microsoft application landscape. In the future we might even consider removing AD FS but this is not in scope now.  Our question:We would like to know from Symplified if this is a supported architecture for Office365/Azure. Is it possible using Symplified as the Identity Provider considering the proposed architecture? Is the 2-way federation possible between Symplified and ADFS? Since Symplified will redirect internal users to the ADFS(for Kerberos auth) and ADFS redirects users to Symplified? Is this going to end in an endless loop when trying to authenticate in the internal DSM network: will Symplified and ADFS keep redirecting to each other? What would be best practice?

The SSO piece would likely occur first as it would have a larger impact on our users.A little bit about our current environment:-Microsoft Active Directory-5 Sites across different countries (Languages: English, Spanish, Italian, and German)-Approx 1000 users-Approximately 150 remote users, who rarely connect via VPNWe are looking for these features:-Quick deployement (of Single Sign On piece), 30-60 days.-Support Windows (XP, 7, 8 Pro), MAC, and mobile (iPad/iPhone/Android)-Quick Support turn around (response w/in 4 hr, solution within 24-48 hours)-Prebuilt connectors for as many vendors as possible. Our list below-Ability to maintain passwords and handle password expiration/changes-Federated solution, ESSO solution, and Identity Management solution-Self Support in case user locked themselvesNice to have features:-Auditing/Reporting capability (active, inactive, last login, etc)-Project Manager/Deployment Manager-Finger-print scanner / Facial recognition (in place of typing initial password)-Least amount of config / admin as possible after initial set upAlso wondering what licensing model looks like.

5390,"RE: Connecting Office365 and OWA through ADFS to Symplified withsupport of Safenet Security tokens. Best practices.","Dear Symplified, Last Tuesday I mailed the mail below asking for feedback on our new Design to connect O365 to Symplified.We already received comments from Microsoft that this connection (O365 &#8211; Symplified) is not supported from the Microsoft end. I would like to receive any feedback regarding this design from Symplified before the end of the day. A “No, this design is not possible because…” is also an answer which would help us. Thanks in advance! Vriendelijke groet / Kind regards /此致,Alain Gardier | SDM Access Management | Global Technical Infrastructure | http://www.dsm.com/en_US/cworld/public/home/images/DSM_Email_EN.jpg  From: Gardier, AlainSent: dinsdag 12 maart 2013 14:30To: support@symplified.comCc: 'Steve Pope'; amcgill@symplified.com McGill; Ivan Djordjevic; Gaal, Robin; Broeckx, MichielSubject: Connecting Office365 and OWA through ADFS to Symplified with support of Safenet Security tokens. Best practices.Importance: High Dear Symplified Support, Regarding the plans we have around Office365 and OWA with strong authentication in particular, I would like you to ask for a Symplified support statement around the architecture that we have in mind. Current Architecture: 1. Within DSM we have defined an Access Management architecture which is mandatory for all access related topics including Office365. In this architecture we have a central Identity Router from Symplified that acts as a central policy point and as a federation hub.2. ADFS is currently connected to Simplified as an Identity Provider, so from the Internal Network, internal users can authenticate to Symplified connected SP’s through ADFS 2.x via Windows Authentication.3. Outlook Web App is currently connected to our ADFS 2.x System and makes use of one factor authentication (UPN &#43; password) which also applies for ActiveSync and Outlook. At this moment we are not compliant with our security policy that states strong authentication for OWA. Due to organizational/project dependencies we postponed the implementation of OWA strong authentication.4. The relation towards the strong authentication provider is done via Symplified. We are using Safenet (before Cryptocard) for two factor authentication using an OTP. Safenet is deployed as a cloud service, where we pass through the email address as claim along with the OTP. In Exchange Online we make use of UPN’s that are identical to the user’s email address. The standard we use is SAML v2 (between Symplified and all other parties). The picture below depicts the current architecture: cid:image004.png@01CE1F25.B0EE47A0   Proposed architecture:In the proposed architecture we are changing two important items:1. We introduce strong authentication for OWA only. Outlook and ActiveSync will remain one factor (until the application supports it).2. Symplified will be the Identity Provider for ADFS and ADFS will be the IDP-HUB for OWA. The picture below depicts the proposed architecture. cid:image005.png@01CE1F26.27E488B0  Important remark is that AD FS becomes nothing more than a pass-through towards Symplified for the Microsoft application landscape. In the future we might even consider removing AD FS but this is not in scope now.  Our question:We would like to know from Symplified if this is a supported architecture for Office365/Azure. Is it possible using Symplified as the Identity Provider considering the proposed architecture? Is the 2-way federation possible between Symplified and ADFS? Since Symplified will redirect internal users to the ADFS(for Kerberos auth) and ADFS redirects users to Symplified? Is this going to end in an endless loop when trying to authenticate in the internal DSM network: will Symplified and ADFS keep redirecting to each other? What would be best practice?

We have run out diagnostic ideas at this point.We believe the idr itself is configured correctly and its seems like the requests are being forwarded to the gateway, and that the gateway is processing and forwarding to the correct proxied machines but the proxied machines are not (obviously) accepting the requests. Need to figure out why that is.
